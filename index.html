          At TUNE I've worked on a broad spectrum of projects across our company's diverse tech portfolio. I can dive into any part of our tech stack but the part I enjoy the most is building intuitive, delightful, and maintainable user interfaces and performant web-client architectures.

              <li>
                Maintaining and developing new web applications with a diverse range of front-end technologies including React/Redux, Node.js, AngularJS, Vue, and even some PHP/jQuery.
